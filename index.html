            <h1>The New RHA</h1>
            <p>Dear Emory Residents,</p>
            <p>My name is Akash Kurupassery, and I am the incoming RHA President for the 2020-2021 academic year. This year I plan to build a team of the hardest-working and most talented students which Emory has to offer to make the Residence Hall Association unsurpassable in the impact we have on Emory residents.</p>
            <p>I have spent the last few weeks overhauling the Executive Board's positional responsibilities compared to previous years, and I encourage you to read them over before applying for an appointed position. Keep in mind that all Executive Board members already have or can create their own committees.</p>
